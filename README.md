# INVADER TONY

A Space Invaders clone with a 90s Italian internet celebrity twist. Four waves of enemies, a three-phase final boss, procedural audio, and a full CRT post-processing pipeline — all in vanilla JavaScript and Three.js with zero framework dependencies.

## Features

- **4 progressive waves** — increasing enemy count, speed, and fire rate across waves 1–4
- **Two enemy types** — basic (suit) and elite (Elvis jumpsuit) with different scoring and animations
- **Three-phase final boss** — Tony Pitony with fan, spiral, circle, and aimed bullet patterns; phase transitions trigger glitch effects and Tony Mode
- **Full post-processing pipeline** — barrel distortion, CRT scanlines, vignette, film grain, chromatic aberration, shockwave ripples
- **Reactive shader effects** — chromatic aberration intensifies as boss HP drops; red screen flash on player hit; warp distortion on wave transition
- **Pixel dissolve death** — enemies burn away with an orange edge glow instead of disappearing instantly
- **Procedural audio** — all sound effects and music synthesised in real-time via Web Audio API, zero audio files
- **Persistent starfield** — 3-layer parallax background with twinkling stars and a periodic shooting star, visible across all screens
- **Leaderboard** — top 10 scores persisted to localStorage (API-ready interface)
- **Mobile support** — landscape-forced layout with on-screen touch controls

## Tech Stack

| Concern | Solution |
|---|---|
| Bundler | [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) |
| 3D / shaders | [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) |
| GLSL import | [vite-plugin-glsl](https://github.com/UstymUkhman/vite-plugin-glsl) |
| Language | Vanilla ES modules, no TypeScript |
| Styling | Plain CSS injected per-page, no framework |
| Package manager | pnpm |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 18
- pnpm (`npm install -g pnpm`)

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cage-invaders.git
cd cage-invaders
pnpm install
```

### Develop

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Opens at `http://localhost:5173`. Hot-reload is active on all JS and GLSL files.

### Build

```bash
pnpm build
```

Output in `dist/`. Chunks are code-split by route — the Three.js bundle only loads when the game page is visited.

### Preview build

```bash
pnpm preview
```

## Assets

PNG sprites are expected at `public/assets/`:

| File | Usage |
|---|---|
| `tony_enemy1.png` | Basic enemy (suit) |
| `tony_enemy2.png` | Elite enemy (Elvis jumpsuit) |
| `tony_boss.png` | Final boss |

Sprites should use transparency (PNG with alpha) and are rendered with `NearestFilter` to preserve pixel-art crispness.

## Performance Notes

- **Object pooling** — bullets (30 player + 30 enemy), particles (200), shockwaves (5) are all pre-allocated. Zero `new` calls in the game loop.
- **Pre-allocated vectors** — `_pA` and `_pB` (THREE.Vector3) are module-level singletons reused for every collision check.
- **Shared textures** — all `basic` enemies share one texture instance; all `elite` enemies share another. Disposed together via `disposeInvaderResources()`.
- **Delta-time capped** — clamped to 50ms per frame to prevent the spiral-of-death on tab focus restore.
- **Background renderer pauses** during gameplay — the game scene has its own embedded starfield, so the background canvas stops its rAF loop to save GPU bandwidth.
